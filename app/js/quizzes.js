/* In-app quizzes, worksheets and the written final.
   Only the QUESTIONS are here. The answer key lives in the private
   plans-and-specs-instructor-keys repo (grading-key.json) and is loaded into the
   Instructor Dashboard, so apprentices can't read the answers in this code.

   Question types:
     mc    – pick one           (options)
     multi – pick all that apply (options)
     num   – number             (unit)
     text  – short answer (auto-graded by keywords, instructor can override)   */
