## Answer keys
Answer keys are **not** in this public repo. They live in the separate private repo
**`jatc-plangrid-instructor-keys`** so apprentices can't look them up. Ask the program
coordinator for access.

## Setup (one time, ~10 minutes)
1. Push this repo to your JATC's GitHub account.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.** Wait for the green check under **Actions**.
3. Open the Pages URL and bookmark/QR-code it for the class.
4. Print the [skills checklist](../docs/skills-checklist.md) and the lab worksheets.

No accounts, no licenses, no student data leaves the device. Each apprentice's work is stored in
their own browser.

## Collecting and grading work (automatic)
Almost everything is graded automatically.

1. Apprentices do the labs in the app and answer every quiz, lab worksheet and the written final
   under **Quizzes & Worksheets** in the app.
2. They tap **Settings → 📤 Turn in to Juan Rodarte** (online – no file). Submitting a quiz also turns
   their work in by itself. Turning in again replaces the older copy.
   *No internet?* **Settings → Export backup (.json)** and send you the file (email, LMS, USB).
3. Open the **Instructor Dashboard** (`…/instructor.html`) and click **☁ Load turned-in work** – everyone who
   turned in loads at once. Drop in **`grading-key.json`** once (private `jatc-plangrid-instructor-keys` repo;
   it's remembered in that browser) and any backup files you were e-mailed.
4. The dashboard scores:

| Assessment | How it's graded |
|---|---|
| Quizzes 1–6 | Answer key (multiple choice, select-all with partial credit, numbers with tolerance, short answers by keywords 👁) |
| Lab 1 | Worksheet vs. answer key |
| Lab 2 | Rubric from their markups (clouds, layers, stamps, hyperlink, exports) |
| Lab 3 | Takeoff worksheet vs. key + their actual measurements in the app |
| Lab 4 | Rubric from their punch items (count, pins, specific titles, assignee/due/priority, photos, closed with comments, CSV export) |
| Lab 5 | Conflict worksheet vs. key + RFI rubric (subject, references, suggestion, impacts, sent/assigned) + submittal + SEE RFI stamp |
| Lab 6 | Rubric from toolbox talk, JHA, photos, inspection request, daily report + compare worksheet |
| Lab 7 | Rubric from as-built markups, dimensions, RFI reference, AS-BUILT stamps, exports |
| 3A PlanGrid Project | Rubric (100 pts) from their project: 5 daily reports with work/material/equipment logs, notes & photos · material documents uploaded · a time sheet for each day · 3 tasks (assigned, you watching, photo, delay/cost, published markups) · 3 RFIs to Juan Rodarte (sent & due dates, published markups) |
| AT&T Reroof Blueprint Exercise | 20 short answers on the real AT&T plan set, scored by keywords 👁 (model answers shown in the detail view) |
| Practice Plan Exercise | Same 20 questions on the Training Center practice set, scored by keywords 👁 |
| Final | Written part vs. key + practical rubric from their project |
| Training missions | All 32 re-checked from their actual work |

5. Only glance at items marked **👁** (short written answers scored by keywords) and read RFIs
   if you want. Type an **override** for any score you disagree with.
6. **Export gradebook CSV** for your records or LMS.

Nothing is uploaded; files are read in your browser only. Overrides and notes are remembered in
that browser – export the CSV to keep a permanent copy.

**Changing questions:** questions live in `app/js/quizzes.js` (public); answers live in
`grading-key.json` (private). If you edit one, update the other with the same question ids.
Never list the correct choice in the same position every time – each apprentice also sees the
choices in their own shuffled order, so "the answer is B" can't be shared.

**Keeping the key safe:** grade on your own computer. The dashboard remembers the key in that
browser – click **Forget key** when you're done on any shared computer.

## 3A PlanGrid Project
Hand-out: [docs/labs/3a-plangrid-project.md](../docs/labs/3a-plangrid-project.md). Apprentices can use the
sample project or create their own (**Settings → New project**, **Sheets → Upload** real plans).
**Juan Rodarte (Instructor)** is on the team of every project automatically, so they can assign RFIs to you
and add you as a watcher. The dashboard grades the apprentice's best project (column **3A Proj**); labs are
still graded on the sample project.

**Team projects (2–4 apprentices):** apprentices use **Team Project** in the app – one starts it and sends a
*team file*, the others join with it, then they swap team files to combine work (works offline, no accounts).
Optional **live sync** makes changes appear on teammates' devices by themselves – one-time setup in
[live-sync-setup.md](live-sync-setup.md). In the dashboard, load **all** teammates' backups: their copies are
combined automatically, every member gets the **team score**, and the 3A detail shows **who did what** –
adjust anyone who didn't contribute with an override.

**Changing a team:** you don't edit teams in the dashboard – any member does it on the **Team Project** page:
**Remove** next to a name, **Leave team** next to their own name, or **+ Add a teammate**, then they send their
team file (or live sync carries it). The latest change wins, even if someone syncs an old file later. When someone
joins, their earlier tasks, punch items, RFIs and daily reports are copied into the team. A person who left or was
removed goes back to their own project (their pre-team work is still there, plus what they made in the team) and
their work is hidden from the team; they are graded on
**their own** work only and the team's score no longer includes it.

**Deleting a team (instructor only):** in instructor mode, open **Team Project** → **All class teams** → **🗑 Delete**
(or **🗑 Delete team** on a team you follow). Each member's tasks, RFIs, punch items and daily reports go back to
their own project, like **Leave team**, so nothing is lost for grading. The team is then removed from every device,
from All class teams, from the invites and from the cloud. Members who are offline get the change the next time
their app is online. Old team files can't bring a deleted team back. This can't be undone.

**Instructor mode in the app (full access):** on your own device open the app → **Settings → Your profile** → pick
**Juan Rodarte** (bottom of the name list) → **Save profile** → type the **instructor passcode** (it's in the
CONFIDENTIAL Instructor Packet – never give it to apprentices). Instructor mode lets you:
- **answer RFIs** sent to you right in the app (apprentices can't answer their own) – the answer reaches the apprentice's app;
- be a **member of every team project** automatically (shown as *Instructor*, never counted in the team's grade or the 2–4 limit);
- see **👨‍🏫 All class teams** on the Team Project page and tap **Follow** to watch any team's work live on your device.
Team projects turn on live sync by themselves so their work reaches you. To leave instructor mode, pick an apprentice name and save.

**Answering their RFIs (RFI inbox) – live:**
1. Open the **Instructor Dashboard** – no files needed. RFIs apprentices send to Juan Rodarte (status Open, not
   Draft) arrive in **📨 RFI inbox** by themselves within a few seconds, while their device is online.
   The button shows how many are waiting; each live RFI has a **● live** tag. Overdue ones are flagged.
2. Type your answer under each RFI – it's saved in that browser as you type.
3. Click **📤 Send answers now**. The answer appears in the apprentice's app by itself (status → **Answered**).

**No internet in class?** Drop the apprentices' backup files into the dashboard – their RFIs show in the same inbox.
Type answers, click **⤓ Download answers file** and send that one file to the class; apprentices open
**RFIs → ⤒ Import instructor answers**. Only their own RFIs are updated.

**Not seeing an RFI?** Check that the apprentice (1) set their name in Settings, (2) put **Juan Rodarte** in
*Assigned to*, (3) saved it as **Open** – a **Draft** is not sent, and (4) had internet. Their app shows
"RFI sent to your instructor's inbox" when it goes through.

To see their markups on the plans, use **Open full project in app** in the apprentice's detail view (on your
own computer – it replaces the project stored in that browser).

Their backup file includes their photos and uploaded documents, so it can be several MB – use email
attachments or a shared drive.

## AT&T Reroof Blueprint Exercise (real plan set)
A 20-question exercise on a real bid set – *AT&T Upper Roof Replacement, 217 W. Acequia Ave, Visalia*
(11 sheets). Good for **Week 3A** (blueprints & details) and **3B** (roofing specs & details).

- **The plans are not on the public site.** Every sheet is stamped *"Proprietary AT&T information – not
  for general use or disclosure outside AT&T"*, so the PDF lives in the private
  `jatc-plangrid-instructor-keys` repo (`plans/`). Hand it out through your LMS, a shared drive or
  print it; apprentices load it in the app with **Sheets → Upload**. Don't post it publicly.
- Apprentices answer in the app (**Quizzes & Worksheets → AT&T Reroof Blueprint Exercise**) or on the
  printable [worksheet](../docs/quizzes/att-reroof-exercise.md).
- Answers and sheet references: `answer-keys.md` in the private repo. The dashboard scores by keywords
  and shows the model answer next to each response – #8, #9 and #20 are open-ended, so read them and
  override as needed.

## Training Center practice plan set (made-up project at the JATC)
The same 20 questions as the AT&T exercise, on an 11-sheet practice set drawn for this class:
*Training Center Roof Replacement, 5537 E. Lamona Ave. #1, Fresno* (made-up consultants and companies;
roof photos on A502 are JATC photos, with some equipment added digitally for training).

- **Getting the plans to apprentices** – use any of these:
  1. **In the app (easiest):** **Sheets → 📐 Load practice plans**. One tap downloads the set from the training
     site and adds all 11 sheets as their own project (*Training Center Roof Replacement (practice plans)*).
     In an empty team project the sheets go into that project, so every teammate taps the button once.
  2. **PDF link / QR code:** `…/jatc-plangrid-training/plans/jatc-training-center-practice-plans.pdf`
     (on the QR code sheet). Apprentices can also load it with **Sheets → Upload**.
  3. **Hand out / print:** e-mail or LMS the PDF, or print it on 36"×24" (ARCH D) – it is drawn to scale at that size.
- **Zooming in stays sharp.** Loaded with the 📐 button, the practice sheets (and the built-in sample sheets) are
  redrawn from the drawing itself at whatever zoom is on screen, so small text and hatching stay crisp. Nothing
  changes for markups or measurements. A device that loaded the plans before this was added fetches the PDF
  again by itself (about 2 MB) the first time a practice sheet is opened. Sheets an apprentice **uploads** are
  stored as a picture, so they still soften when zoomed far in.
- Apprentices answer under **Quizzes & Worksheets → Training Center Reroof – Practice Plan Exercise** (or the
  printable [worksheet](../docs/quizzes/practice-plans-exercise.md)). The dashboard grades it in the **Practice**
  column once `grading-key.json` is loaded.
- The practice set is also a good choice for the **3A PlanGrid Project** – RFIs, tasks and daily reports on a
  real-looking bid set instead of the sample drawings.
- Answers with sheet references: `answer-keys.md` (private repo) → *Training Center Reroof – practice plan set*,
  and the Word file *JATC Training Center Reroof – Answer Key (INSTRUCTOR)*. Read #8, #9 and #20 – they are open-ended.

## Tips
- Project the app with the browser zoomed to 125%.
- Calibrate *wrong* on purpose first (type 60' instead of 100') and measure the roof – let them see
  what a bad scale does to a bid.
- Lab 4 Option A: plant 6–10 real defects on the shop mock-up and hand out seam probes.
- Lab 5 is the most valuable lab: the RTU-4 curb doesn't leave room for 8" of flashing once the
  taper, flat insulation and cover board are added. Let stronger apprentices find it on their own.
- Use real (non-confidential) roof plans from a past job: **Sheets → Upload** accepts multi-page
  PDFs. Remove client names first.

## Resetting
**Settings → Reset training data** restores the sample project in that browser.

## Customizing
See the README "Customizing for your JATC" section. Everything is plain HTML/JS – no build tools.
