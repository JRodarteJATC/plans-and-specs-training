# Plan Room Trainer – JATC Construction Plan Software Training

A hands-on training kit that teaches **roofer and waterproofer apprentices** how to use
construction plan-management software such as **PlanGrid / Autodesk Build**, Procore Drawings,
Fieldwire and Bluebeam.

It has two parts:

1. **Plan Room Trainer** (`app/`) – a practice web app that works like PlanGrid. It runs in
   any browser, needs no login, and comes loaded with a fictional 7-sheet roofing & below-grade
   waterproofing drawing set.
   Apprentices can make mistakes here without touching a real project.
2. **Curriculum** (`docs/`, `instructor/`) – 8 lessons, hands-on labs, quizzes, a final exam,
   an instructor guide and a skills checklist. **Answer keys are kept in a separate private repo**
   (`plans-and-specs-instructor-keys`) so apprentices can't look them up.

> **Not affiliated with Autodesk.** PlanGrid, Autodesk Build, Procore, Fieldwire and Bluebeam are
> trademarks of their owners. This is an independent training tool. The drawings are fictional
> and marked *NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION*.

---

**Curriculum fit:** built for the specs & blueprint weeks of the Central Valley Roofers JATC
Standards, Exhibit C – **Week 3A Advanced Specs, Blueprints & Details** (default), 3B Roofing Specs &
Details and 3C Waterproofing Specs & Details. See the instructor guide for the full mapping.

## Quick start

**Option A – just open it (no install)**
1. Download the repo (green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**) and unzip it.
2. Open `app/index.html` in Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox.

**Option B – GitHub Pages (best for a class)**
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. The included workflow publishes the app. Every apprentice uses the same link, e.g.
   `https://<your-org>.github.io/plans-and-specs-training/`.

**Option C – local web server**
```bash
cd app
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Work is saved in each apprentice's browser. To turn work in, apprentices use
**Settings → Export backup (.json)** and send you the file. Drop all the files into the
**Instructor Dashboard** (`instructor.html`, linked from Settings) to grade the whole class at once.

| **Quizzes & worksheets** | All 6 quizzes, the lab worksheets and the written final are answered in the app (multiple choice, select-all, numbers, short answer) and saved in the apprentice's backup |
| **Automatic grading** | Instructor Dashboard grades the whole class at once: quizzes and worksheets against a private answer key, lab work and the final practical by rubric straight from each apprentice's project, all 32 missions – with overrides, notes and CSV gradebook export. No server; nothing uploaded |

See [`docs/feature-map.md`](docs/feature-map.md) for where each feature lives in the real
PlanGrid / Autodesk Build and other apps.

## The sample project

*Central Valley Training Center – Bldg B* – a fictional 100' × 64' building with a 60-mil TPO
roof over tapered polyiso, and a 60' × 40' basement with below-grade sheet waterproofing.

| Sheet | Title | Used to teach |
|---|---|---|
| R-001 | Roofing Symbols, Notes & Sheet Index | Reading legends and general notes |
| R-101 | Roof Plan (Rev 0 and Rev 1 / ASI-01) | Drains, overflows, crickets, curbs, penetrations, walkway pads, measuring, squares, counting, revisions, compare |
| R-102 | Tapered Insulation Plan | Reading slope and insulation thickness |
| R-501 | Roof Details | Parapet flashing & coping, roof drain, pipe boot, curb flashing |
| R-601 | Roof & Waterproofing Schedules | Roof assembly, drain schedule, below-grade assembly, warranty & testing |
| W-101 | Below-Grade Waterproofing Plan | Foundation wall WP, footing drain, elevator pit, pipe sleeves |
| W-501 | Waterproofing Details | Wall section, blindside pit, pipe penetration |

Also seeded: team (foreman, GC, architect, manufacturer's rep), open issues (ponding, failed seam
probe, honeycomb in foundation wall), an answered RFI, four Division 07 submittals, TPO and
waterproofing specs, ASI-01, a fall-protection toolbox talk and a daily report.

A deliberate conflict is built into the set for the RFI lab (Lab 5).

## Running the tests (optional, for maintainers)

npm test
```

## Customizing for your JATC

- **Use your own drawings:** upload PDFs in the app, or add sheets in `app/js/sample-sheets.js`.
- **Change the seed project** (team names, RFIs, specs): edit `seedProject()` in `app/js/store.js`.
- **Add missions:** add an entry to `MODULES` in `app/js/training.js` with a `check()` function.
- Bump `VERSION` in `store.js` after changing seed data so browsers load the new sample.
